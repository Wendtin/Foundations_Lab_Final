## Security Foundations: Governance & Frameworks
**CIA Triad**
The CIA triad represents the three pillars of information security: confidentiality, integrity, and availability. It serves as a foundational framework for protecting information and is used as a checklist for security practitioners to ensure all angles of a security project are covered.
**AAA Framework**
Authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) is a security framework that controls access to computer resources, enforces policies, and audits usage. AAA and its combined processes play a major role in network management and cybersecurity by screening users and keeping track of their activity while they are connected, aligning with the principles of the CIA triad to ensure data security.

**Governance effect on cybersecurity**  
Governance affects cybersecurity roles by establishing the strategic direction, assigning specific responsibilities across the organization, and bridging the gap between technical operations and senior leadership. Cybersecurity governance is essential for keeping sensitive data and digital assets safe from cyber threats. It creates clear rules and processes to protect information and helps organizations stay prepared for new risks. (What Is Cybersecurity Governance and Why Does It Matter ?.

**Why is governance just as important as technical skill in cybersecurity?**
Governance is considered as important as technical skill because it provides the strategic direction, accountability, and organizational structure necessary for technical tools to be effective. While technical skills represent the "how" of security—such as hacking, scanning, or patching—governance provides the "why" and the "where," ensuring that security efforts align with business goals and legal obligations.

**Which cybersecurity domain (Network, GRC, or Cloud) aligns most with today’s material?**  
GRC (Governance, Risk, and Compliance) is the material that strongly aligns with the  cybersecurity domain because it focuses on structured security frameworks, control implementation, and regulatory requirements rather than purely technical configurations.It embeds the technical aspects of cybersecurity. Topics such as the Critical Security Controls, the National Institute of Standards and Technology Cybersecurity Framework, and Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard emphasize risk management, policy development, compliance validation, and security governance processes. While AAA (Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting) has technical applications in network and identity security, within this context it functions as a control mechanism required by governance frameworks and compliance standards. Overall, the material centers on managing security through policies, controls, and regulatory alignment, which are core elements of the GRC domain.  

## Executive Summary
This repository establishes a secure version-control pipeline using Git and GitHub. This deployment ensures 100% traceability of configuration changes and provides a centralized audit trail for forensic or compliance reviews.
